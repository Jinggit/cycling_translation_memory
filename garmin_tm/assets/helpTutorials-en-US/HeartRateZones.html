<b>Heart Rate Zones</b><br/>
Heart Rate Zones allow you to set the minimum and maximum values of five different beats per minute (bpm) zones. Using Heart Rate zones to guide your
training can help you get more out of your hard work.
<br/><br/>

&#149; You can change the default heart rate zones. You may also create and edit heart rate zones specific to each sport.
<br/><br/>

&#149; Enter the lowest value for each field.
<br/><br/>

Zone 1 - Warm Up: Estimated 50%-60% of your max heart rate. Improves ability of your heart to pump blood and your muscles' ability to utilize oxygen.
Fitness level = walking briskly.
<br/><br/>

Zone 2 - Easy: Estimated 60%-70% of your max heart rate. Increases the rate of fat release from cells to muscle. Fitness level = slow jogging.
<br/><br/>

Zone 3 - Aerobic: Estimated 70% - 80% of your max heart rate. Increases lung capacity and respiratory rate. Strengthens your heart for longer exercise.
Fitness level = Easy running.
<br/><br/>

Zone 4 - Threshold: Estimated 80%-90% of your max heart rate. Muscles "burn" while working out. Your ability to run faster and become more fit improves.
Limited time to train in this zone. Fitness level = fast run.
<br/><br/>

Zone 5 - Maximum: Estimated 90%-100% of max heart rate. Used mostly for interval training with short bursts. Increased potential for injury. Very limited
time to train in this zone. Fitness level = Very fast running
<br/><br/>

<b>Power Zones</b><br/>
Garmin Connect will use your Functional Threshold
Power (FTP) to determine your cycling power zones.
You can alter your zones by adjusting the watts or %
of FTP values. When you have completed a cycling
activity using a power meter, view your power zones
and charts in the activity details view.
<br/><br/>

<b>What is Functional Threshold Power?</b><br/>

Functional Threshold Power (FTP) is a measurement
from power meters. It is considered to be the highest
power level you can maintain for one hour without
growing fatigued . FTP is benecial because it
provides an outlook on performance ability.
Determining your FTP can be done through an FTP
test using the Edge 520 or 1000.
<br/><br/>
For instructions for performing an FTP test using the
Edge 520 refer to page 10 of the Owner's Manual.
<br/><br/>
For instructions for performing an FTP test using the
Edge 1000 refer to the following FAQ content: How
do I calculate my Functional Threshold Power using
the Edge 1000?
