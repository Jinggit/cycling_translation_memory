<b>How can I obtain my resting heart rate?</b><br/>
A good way to measure your resting heart rate is during the morning right after you've awaken from sleep. Count the number of times your heart beats for 1 minute.
You can also wear your heart rate monitor and track your heart rate on your Garmin device while your body is at complete rest. You may want to take 3 measurements
and average them for a more representative reading.
<br/><br/>

<b>I'm familiar with % max HR but what does %HRR mean?</b><br/>
Percent Heart Rate Reserve (%HRR) is defined as the difference between your maximum heart rate and your resting heart rate. Heart rate reserve creates logical
boundaries around which your heart rate will fluctuate during an activity. Utilizing your resting heart rate can help you further personalize your training.
<br/><br/>

<b>Why did my heart rate zones change when I entered my resting heart rate?</b><br/>
When you entered your resting heart rate, your heart rate reserve was created and your adjusted zone levels are based on that. To calculate a heart rate zone
level, take your intensity % and multiply it by the quantity of the difference between your maximum heart rate and your resting heart rate and add that result to
your resting heart rate.
<br/><br/>

<b>When would I edit in % mode as opposed to in beats per minute mode?</b><br/>
Editing zones in percent is an easy way to segment your heart rate responses. You can simply provide your max heart rate and resting heart rate and select the
percent ranges that are meaningful to you. Editing in beats per minute allows more precise definition of your heart rate zones. For example, you may wish to define
your heart rate zones according to perceived levels of exertion such as heart rates in which you would find it difficult to talk. Or you may establish custom zones
based on levels you've observed during performance testing.
<br/><br/>

<b>How many heart rate zones can I have?</b><br/>
You must have at least one zone and can have up to ten zones on Garmin Connect. Garmin fitness devices are limited to 5 heart rate zones so keep that in mind when
modifying your zone levels.
