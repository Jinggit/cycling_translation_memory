Heart rate zones help you understand how intensely you are training. Choose one of these popular methods to calculate your heart rate zones:<br/><br/>

<b>Percent of Max Heart Rate</b><br/>
This method is the most common and most familiar, using only your maximum heart rate to determine your training zones. Your resting heart rate and fitness level are not used in this calculation.
<br/><br/>

<b>Percent of Lactate Threshold Heart Rate</b><br/>
When your body begins to accumulate lactic acid faster than you can flush it out, thatâ€™s your lactate threshold. This method uses your heart rate at your lactic threshold to calculate training zones.
<br/><br/>

<b>Percent of Heart Rate Reserve</b><br/>
If you know your resting heart rate and your max heart rate, you can calculate your heart rate reserve. (HRmax-HRrest=HRreserve) As your fitness improves, your resting heart rate often drops, giving you a larger heart rate reserve and different training zones.
