            <p><strong>Share your position</strong></p>
            <p>Use LiveTrack to share activities from your Garmin device in real-time.</p>
            <p>Start a LiveTrack session in two easy steps:</p>

            <ol style="padding-left:20px">
                <li> Add/invite recipients to view your LiveTrack session. Each time you create a new LiveTrack session, your invites will receive a link. You can edit this list each time you start a new LiveTrack session.</li></br>
                <li> Start the LiveTrack session then start an activity on your Garmin device. As long as the app and your Garmin device are connected, your activity will be shared in real-time with those invited.</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Auto Start</strong></p>
            <p>Auto Start allows your Auto Start compatible device to begin LiveTrack sessions when you start an activity without opening the app on your phone. The LiveTrack session will use your sharing settings.</p>

            <p>In some situations, your Facebook or Twitter verifications can expire. Selecting Email as an additional share method can ensure that your LiveTrack sessions are always shared.</p>

            <p><strong>Share Session</strong></p>
            <p>To use LiveTrack, at least one sharing method must be turned on. After starting a LiveTrack session, your friends can watch by viewing the link created by LiveTrack.</p>

            <p><strong>Strava Beacon</strong></p>
            <p>Share your LiveTrack session with Strava users through Beacon. From your Strava Premium account:</p>
            <ol style="padding-left:20px">
                <li> Link your Garmin account with Strava.</li></br>
                <li> Enable Beacon's sharing feature with Garmin LiveTrack.</li></br>
                <li> Select the Strava users who will view your shared Beacon sessions.</li></br>
            </ol>

            <p>From Garmin Connect Mobile:</p>
            <p>Once Beacon sharing is enabled from your Strava account, your LiveTrack sessions will be shared with your Strava friends through Beacon.</p>

            <p>You can turn your Strava sharing on and off from your Strava account.</p>
            </div>
