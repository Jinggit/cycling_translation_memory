    <string name="gct_help_section2">Garmin has researched many runners of all different levels. In general, more experienced runners tend to have shorter ground contact times. Elite runners often have ground contact times of less than 200 ms. Virtually all experienced runners studied have ground contact times of less than 300 ms. Higher cadence and faster paces are both associated with shorter ground contact times. Many running coaches believe that a short ground contact time is characteristic of a more economical running form. However, at a set cadence, decrease of ground contact time usually increases vertical oscillation.</string>

The colors show how your ground contact time balance compares to other runners. The color zones are based on percentiles."</string>
    <string name="gctb_help_section2">Many coaches believe that a symmetrical gait is most desirable for performance and injury prevention. Garmin has researched many runners of all different levels to determine typical ground contact balance ranges. Testing has shown that for many runners GCT Balance tends to deviate further from 50 - 50 when running up or down hills. Some runners report that injuries are reflected in their GCT Balance.</string>
