<p>Available to Premium members, the Strava Suffer Score is an analysis of your heart rate data. By tracking your heart rate through your workout and its level relative to your maximum heart rate, we calculate a value to show exactly how hard you worked. The more time you spend going full gas and the longer your activity, the higher the score. Compare your Suffer Score with friends and pros, see if you can do a truly epic workout, and motivate yourself to push that extra bit harder! The Suffer Score was inspired by the concept of TRIMP (TRaining IMPulse) coined by Dr. Eric Bannister.</p>
