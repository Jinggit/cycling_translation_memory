Hey there,<br/><br/>

You should try Strava. It lets you track your runs and rides and provides great activity stats to show your improvement over time. It'll also let us follow each other's activities (and get competitive when we feel like it).<br/>
Click here to download &mdash; it's free &mdash; and follow me: <a href="%1$s" target="_blank">https://www.strava.com/register/free</a><br/><br/>
