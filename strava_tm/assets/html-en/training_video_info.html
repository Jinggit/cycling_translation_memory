<p>Make your indoor training count with our addition of Premium training videos brought to you by Strava, FitStar, and CTS.</p>

<p>This feature is available to Premium members and allows you to access a growing library of training videos that help you improve with a variety of tailored workouts and motivational content. You can watch these videos as often and whenever you like as long as you have a data connection. We recommend connecting through wifi to avoid possible cellular data costs. When completing a workout video, you can easily create a manual entry that represents your activity on Strava.</p>
<br />
<b>Do I need any additional equipment?</b>
<p>For cycling videos, you need an indoor trainer to follow the video instructions. For other videos, nothing else is needed.</p>
<br />
<b>Can I access these videos on my computer?</b>
<p>Yes, videos are currently available for Premium members on the Strava website.</p>
<br />
<b>Can I play these videos on my iPad or Android Tablet?</b>
<p>Yes, you can install the phone version of the app and play the videos in full screen mode.</p>
<br />
<b>Can I stream these on my TV?</b>
<p>Yes, on iOS you can stream to Apple TV using AirPlay. On Android you can use an HDMI cable to connect to a TV.</p>
<br />
<b>Can I associate my trainer activities recorded on a dedicated GPS device with a video from CTS?</b>
